.. warning::
    Our application employs user impersonation for establishing a connection with Business Central. As a result, our integration inherits the permissions of the user initiating the connection. 
    Consequently, it's critical that this user possesses the necessary permissions for **read and write** access to the API. 
    Additionally, the user must have the authority to approve **'Azure Applications'** for your organization.
